# Predictive-Model-for-Neonatal-Sepsis-Detection
Developed a model to identify newborns with sepsis using lab findings, clinical indicators, and vital signs. Achieved ROC of 0.93 and sensitivity of 99.8%. Applied SMOTE to improve specificity to 40.1%. Used SHAP analysis to evaluate feature contributions, refining the model for better sensitivity and specificity balance.
